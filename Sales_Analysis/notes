Model Selection: Choose a machine learning model to use. This could be a simple model like logistic regression, or a more complex model like a random forest or a gradient boosting machine. This choice will depend on the specifics of your data.

Model Training: Train your chosen model on your training data. This involves providing the model with your selected features and the labels you defined earlier.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate your model's performance on your test data. This will give you an idea of how well your model is likely to perform on unseen data. You might use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or area under the ROC curve for this evaluation.

Model Tuning: Based on the performance of your model, you might decide to go back and tweak some things. This could involve changing the features you're using, changing the model you're using, or tuning your model's parameters.
